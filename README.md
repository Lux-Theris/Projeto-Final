<h1>Interactive RPG Character Sheet</h1>

<p>This is a personal project with the objective to be a interactive character sheets for my own system of RPG that I DM for some friends, and it also server as the final project of a programming course I'm taking
As programming is kinda of new and I'm still a noob when it comes to it, expect some weird stuff in the code. I'll revisit this project at a later date when I update my RPG system or want to update some code
